**preducks** is a visual prototyping tool for developers employing **React** component architecture alongside the comprehensive type checking of **TypeScript**.
In other words, **you can draw prototypes and export React / Typescript code!**

**preducks** allows the user to _visualize_ their application architecture dynamically, employing a _canvas display_, an _application tree_, and a _real-time component code preview_. The user can create components and load _instances_ of these components, as well as nested HTML elements, onto the canvas. This architecture can then be _exported_ as TypeScript application files to be used as a starter template for any repository.
